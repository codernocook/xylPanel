1. Run the html file, with browser
2. Under **Websocket Ip**, enter the address of the target ip, if it's self-hosted. Make sure to port-forward. If you still not then, I recommend to connect with local ip address, it usually start with "192.168.x.x"
3. Under **Websocket Port**, enter the port, if you still not port-forward, then connect with local ip address
